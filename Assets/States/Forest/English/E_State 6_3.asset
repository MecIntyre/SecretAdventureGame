  storyText: 'Walking the forest grounds, Randy take notice of the curvy forestway
    that is leading downwards, serpentine likely.

    Very close he can avoid a
    jump from behind, of a angry myconide... it falls all the way down like a rolling
    stone.


    There are two ways, the hero could possibly be going.


    1. Follow
    the forest way ahead...

    2. Turn back and trying to find another way...
