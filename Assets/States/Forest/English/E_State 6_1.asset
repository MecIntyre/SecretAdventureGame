  storyText: 'Walking the forest grounds, Randy take notice of the curvy forestway
    that is leading downwards, serpentine likely.

    Very close he can avoid a
    jump from behind, of a angry myconide... it falls all the way down like a rolling
    stone.


    There is only one way the hero actually would go, because the other
    way follows to the exit of the forest, which is no option without the sword and
    the talisman.


    1. Turn back and trying to find another way...
